#Question 1
# Use the function type on the slides
# Justify the answers, for basic ones, "it's a simple addition and the result is 5"
#result = 2 + 3
#print(2 + 3)
#print(6 / 2)
#print(2 != 3)

#Question 3
#Assume that the operation are executed in order. What will each print display:
#a = 2
#b = 3
#c = "abc"
#print(a,b,c)


#Question 5
#Write a function that takes an integer as parameter and returns a list of all the divisors of that number:
